/**
 * LandingCondition determines whether a spaceship has safely landed on Titan.
 *
 * A landing is considered successful if:
 *
 * The spaceship is very close to the surface (within a small altitude tolerance),
 * Its speed is low enough not to damage it or bounce back (below maxLandingSpeed).
 *
 * Altitude is calculated as the vertical (Y-axis) distance between the ship's position
 * and the terrain surface at that point (from TitanEnvironment). The speed is based on
 * the full 3D velocity vector magnitude.
 *
 * Typical values:
 *
 * altitudeTolerance: ~1 meter (acceptable offset from surface)
 * maxLandingSpeed: ~1â€“5 m/s (depending on landing gear and realism)
